# AES/RSA implementation whit Python

### Practica07-1
In this code I made a simple practice of an implementation of an encrypt/decrypt program as a school project using RSA and AES algorithms, this implementation uses the Tkinter module to create a GUI to give some interaction with users, and implements Pycryptodome for encryption and decryption. This is only a student practice that shows how it works the both algorithms together.

### Keygen
For a good work, it's necessary to use the "keygen.py" program before of "Practica07-1.py" because this will generate a couple of keys, public and private, that it will needed to make the encrypt and decrypt process, you must be ensure that use the private key to encrypt and the public key to decrypt.

This file is just for testing the program.
